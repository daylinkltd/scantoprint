I have created new next app.
Im upto creating project, the project where it solve an problem of printing/xerox stores from keeping the files of the customer in 
thier computer 

there two parts in it one is the Store side and another is stores customer side 

for the store side the store owner registeres in this platform by which after Registeration 
an QR code is generated for that store.

for the Customer side when the customer scans the QR code an Upload menu where an user uploads an images 
which should be printed this uploaded image will be shown in the Store owners page and the store owner can print it without downloading 
it directly from there. 

we need to implement some privacy features like saving in computer should be allowed from the store owner side. 

so that comfidential files should not be with the store.
